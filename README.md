# **Scenario**
Today is Alice's first day at Wayne Enterprises' Security Operations Center. Lucius sits Alice down and gives her the first assignment: A memo from the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). GCPD has found evidence online (http://pastebin.com/Gw6dWjS9) that the website www.imreallynotbatman.com hosted on Wayne Enterprises' IP address space has been compromised. The group has multiple objectives, but a key aspect of their modus operandi is defacing websites to embarrass their victim. Lucius has asked Alice to determine if www.imreallynotbatman.com (the personal blog of Wayne Corporation‚Äôs CEO) was compromised.

# **INTRO TO THE DEFACEMENT** 
## **Your Assignment (Objectives)**  
Your primary goal is to conduct a thorough investigation into the suspected defacement of the website imreallynotbatman.com. This includes establishing the extent of the impact, determining the exact timing of the incident, and mapping out the attacker's route and infrastructure. To effectively monitor for future threats, you are expected to produce Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and develop a repeatable set of searches and alerts.

1. **Artifact Confirmation**: Confirm the alteration of the defaced JPEG on the website and document the date and time of the incident.
2. **Activity Analysis**:   Investigate any prior scanning activity and examine the website's CMS or tech stack, focusing on potential upload or authentication routes used by the attacker.
3. **Attribution of Findings**: Use signals like dynamic DNS, FQDNs, source IPs, and filenames to help identify the attacker‚Äôs profile and infrastructure.
4. **Brute-Force Activity Quantification**: Assess any brute-force attempts, noting time frames of credential successes to identify exploited patterns.
5. **Packaging of Findings**: Compile your findings into a resource package that includes detection methods, containment actions, and recommendations for strengthening website security.

## **Evidence Artifacts**  
The following artifacts are crucial in establishing context and providing a timeline to anchor your Splunk pivots during the investigation:
- **GCPD memo (Po1s0n1vy):** https://botscontent.netlify.app/v1/gcpd-poisonivy-memo.html  
- **Alice‚Äôs journal (Sep 1‚Äì13, 2016):** https://botscontent.netlify.app/v1/alice-journal.html  
- **Pastebin tip (defacement claim):** `http://pastebin.com/Gw6dWjS9`  

---

## **Hunt Setup & Pre-Engagement**  
To prepare for your investigation, I have staged the environment and configured Splunk for targeted hunts. This involved pivoting through HTTP/IDS data and authentication signals to both confirm the defacement and trace its root cause.

**Preparation (Evidence Review)**:  
- Begin by skimming through the **GCPD memo** + **Alice‚Äôs journal** to establish a cohesive timeframe and identify any potential suspects involved in the incident.  
- Document candidate IoCs, including IP addresses, fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), filenames, and hashes, to facilitate swift searches throughout your analysis.  
- Create a plan for subsequent pivots, focusing on various elements such as HTTP content types, user agents, POST/upload paths, and bursts of authentication attempts to uncover any suspicious activities.

**Splunk Hunt Setup**: 
- **Time window:** Sep 1‚Äì13, 2016 ‚Üí tighten to exact defacement time once found.
- **Primary asset(s):** `imreallynotbatman.com` ‚Ä¢ Web server `dest_ip ‚âà 192.168.250.70` (BOTS v1).
- **Data sources:** `stream:http`, `suricata`, `stream:dns` (plus server logs if present).

**Pro Tips**:  
- Use the **Fields** sidebar (e.g., `src_ip`, `useragent`, `content_type`, `http_method`).  
- Save strong searches as **Reports** ‚Üí later convert to **Alerts/Dashboards**.  
- Track IoCs and timestamps in a scratchpad for quick cross-pivots.  
- Validate findings with screenshots and exact event times for handoff.

## Defacement Step 106 ‚Äî Get the dest_ip (POST brute-force at web server)
What IPv4 address is likely attempting a brute-force password attack against imreallynotbatman.com?
- We can use the dest_ip to query what IP Address has been hitting the server using the query "sourcetype=stream" " dest_ip" and head to src_ip. We see 99% for IP 23.22.63.114.
- Enter Search: index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:HTTP" http_method="POST" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" form_data=*username*passwd*

Goal: Identify the IP likely running brute-force POSTs against the site.

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http http_method=POST dest_ip=192.168.250.70
| stats count by src_ip

üëâ They have been intentionally skipped in this walkthrough.

---

## Defacement Step 108 ‚Äî Brute-force Network Trail (repeat check)
What IPv4 address is likely attempting a brute-force password attack against imreallynotbatman.com? <br /> 
- We can use the dest_ip to query what IP Address has been hitting the server using the query "sourcetype=stream" "dest_ip" and head to the src_ip. We see 99% for IP 23.22.63.114.
- Enter Search: index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:HTTP" http_method="POST" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" form_data=*username*passwd*

Goal: Re-validate the brute-force source IP around the POST attempts.

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http http_method=POST dest_ip=192.168.250.70 form_data=*username*passwd*

## Defacement Step 109 ‚Äî Filenames (uploaded executable)
What is the name of the executable uploaded by Po1s0n1vy?
- Since we already have Po1s0n1vy's network traffic, we can filter it by adding ".exe" to our index.
- We find 3791.exe in the "fileinfo. Filename. " When we open it, we see that Po1s0n1vy uploaded it.
- Enter Search: index="botsv1" sourcetype="suricata" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http.http_method=POST¬†.exe

Goal: Find the executable uploaded prior to defacement.
> Answer guidance: Include the extension (e.g., `notepad.exe` or `favicon.ico`).

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=suricata dest_ip=192.168.250.70 http.http_method=POST ".exe"
| eval filename=coalesce(fileinfo.filename, http.uri)
| table _time src_ip dest_ip filename
| sort _time

```
- [ ] **Answer:** `3791.exe`

## Defacement Step 110 ‚Äî MD5 of Uploaded File (Crowdsource Your Way To a¬†Solution)
What is the MD5 hash of the executable uploaded? 
- Using AlienVault.com, we input the target's IP address and examine the traffic details. We then find the SHA-Hash.
- The command "|stats values (MD5)" inputs the IP and sees its traffic to verify the details.

Goal: Collect hash evidence for enrichment and blocking.

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=suricata dest_ip=192.168.250.70 http.http_method=POST ".exe"
| stats values(fileinfo.filename) as file values(fileinfo.md5) as md5 values(fileinfo.sha256) as sha256 by src_ip

## Defacement Step 111 ‚Äî Scan the IPs (SHA256)
GCPD reported that common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) for the Po1s0n1vy APT group, if the initial compromise fails, are to send a spear phishing email with custom malware attached to their intended target. This malware is typically associated with Po1s0n1vys' initial attack infrastructure. Using research techniques, provide the SHA256 hash of this malware.
- We can use tools like Virustotal.com to scan the attacker's IP address. This allows us to see the SHA256 found under basic properties.

Goal: Enrich with external intel to confirm related malware and infrastructure.

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=suricata (fileinfo.sha256=* OR "*sha256*")
| stats values(fileinfo.sha256) as sha256 values(http.hostname) as host by http.uri

## Defacement Step 114 ‚Äî Return to Basics
What was the first brute-force password used?
- At first, you might get lost and overwhelmed by the hundreds of entries that could have your password. However, our search narrows when we return to the prior query, filter, and sort entries by date.
- Go back to our index "botsv1 query. " Remove the¬†.exe and replace it with "| table _time form_data" to see the needed detail sorted by event time and date. We can head to the earliest date and see the first password attempted.
- Enter Search: index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:http" http_method="POST" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" form_data=*username*passwd* | table _time form_data

**SPL**

## Defacement Step 115 ‚Äî Google's Your Friend
One of the passwords in the brute force attack is James Brodsky's favorite Coldplay song. We are looking for a six-character word on this one. Which is it?
- You can look online for Coldplay songs that have only six characters.
- We found 37 songs, in total, that James could have used. `Pictures 3.0`
- We can cross-check from our index in Splunk and filter for passwords for the number of characters and length.
- We can use the pipe or "|" to insert the passwords we think could work. Rinse and repeat until you have searched through all the songs. Use "| where userpassword in" ("insert_1", "insert_1", "insert_1", "insert_1"")
- Enter Search: index="botsv1" sourcetype=" stream:http" http_method=POST dest_ip="192.168.250.70" form_data=*username*passwd* | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<userpassword>\w+)" | eval pwlen=len(userpassword) | search pwlen=6 | where userpassword in ("clocks", "oceans", "sparks", "shiver", "yellow") | table userpassword

Goal: Identify a 6-character password used during the brute-force.

**SPL**
```

## Defacement Step 116 ‚Äî Rex Expressions
What was the correct password for admin access to the content management system running "imreallynotbatman.com"?
- Using the previous query from 114, we can look at adding rex expressions.
- Remove the password filter by count and add "| rex field=form_data" and | stats count by to get the amount.
- Now that we see the accessed passwords, we can sort them by count from top to bottom.
- Batman has been used more than once, whereas the others seem to have been accessed once. `Pictures 3.2`
- From here, we can open Batman to verify our suspicion. `Pictures 3.3`
- Enter Search: index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:http" http_method=POST dest_ip="192.168.250.70" form_data=*username*passwd* | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<userpassword>\w+)" | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<userpassword>\w+)" | stats count by userpassword

Goal: Determine the most frequently used password seen in POSTs.

What was the average password length used in the password brute-forcing attempt?
- We are confident that we have all the necessary information in this index. We can start by organizing the data by using "| eval length=len(passwd) " and heading to the "length" in INTERESTING FIELDS. And we see an average of 6. `Pictures 3.4`
- I also found that you can use "| eval length=len(passwd) " and "| stats avg(length)" in our query to get the integer. `Pictures 3.5`
- Enter Search: index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd
- Enter Search: | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" | eval length=len(passwd) | stats avg(length)

Goal: Measure average brute-force password length (round to nearest whole).
> Answer guidance: Round to the closest whole integer. For example, "5" is not "5.23213"

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http dest_ip=192.168.250.70 http_method=POST form_data=*username*passwd*
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<password>\w+)"
| eval length=len(password)
| stats avg(length) as avg_len
| eval avg_len=round(avg_len,0)
```
- [ ] **Answer:** `6`

## Defacement Step 118 ‚Äî Round Two (Seconds between ‚Äúfound correct password‚Äù and login)
How many seconds elapsed between when the brute force password scan identified the correct password and the compromised login?
- Search for the password "batman" and filter the transaction and event durations.
- We use a "| transaction userpassword| and "eval dur=round(duration, 2)." The "dur" field on the left shows 92.17.
- Enter Search: index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" | search passwd=batman | transaction passwd | eval dur=round(duration, 2) | table dur
- Enter Search: index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" | search passwd=batman | transaction passwd | eval dur=round(duration, 2)

Goal: Time from password discovery to successful compromise.
> Answer guidance: Round to two decimals (e.g., 92.17).

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http dest_ip=192.168.250.70 http_method=POST form_data=*username*passwd*
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<password>\w+)"
| search password=batman
| transaction password maxspan=10m
| eval seconds=round(duration,2)
| table _time _time_end seconds
```
- [ ] **Answer:** 92.17

## Defacement 119 ‚Äî More Than One Way (Unique passwords attempted)
How many unique passwords were attempted in the brute force attempt?
- We have two options from here: We can once again stay in the same query, remove the transaction filters, and filter it by events.
- We can use the " | stats dc by userpassword."
- Alternatively, we can go back to 116, as we searched for password events in that query and sorted them by count.
- Instead, in that query, we can go to the "Statistics" bar and see that there are 412 events in total.

Goal: Count the distinct passwords used in the brute-force.

**SPL**
```
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http dest_ip=192.168.250.70 http_method=POST form_data=*username*passwd*
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<password>\w+)"
| stats dc(password) as unique_passwords
```
- [ ] **Answer:** `412`

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Bound the Window      | Mark first complaint + last known-good render              | Keep searches tight and relevant         |
| Surface Scanners      | Find noisy sources probing the domain                      | Identify likely entry/pressure points    |
| Fingerprint the Stack | Confirm CMS/tech (e.g., Joomla)                            | Narrow vuln paths & admin/upload areas   |
| Prove Defacement      | Locate altered artifact + exact change time                | Validate impact and anchor the timeline  |
| Pivot to POSTs/Uploads| Trace requests right before change; inspect form data      | Reveal upload vectors and abused routes  |
| Auth Precursors       | Detect failed ‚Üí success bursts / credential stuffing       | Tie credential misuse to the compromise  |
| Map Attacker Infra    | Extract dynamic-DNS FQDNs + staging IPs                    | Attribute infra; expand IoCs             |

| Collect IoCs & Evidence | Capture IPs, UAs, filenames, hashes, screenshots        | Support containment & post-mortems       |
| Contain & Recover     | Block IoCs, restore clean files, rotate credentials        | Stop activity and return to good state   |
| Harden                | WAF/rate limits, restrict uploads/admin, tune FIM          | Reduce recurrence & shrink attack surface|

## üìö **Lessons Learned**
- [ ] **Visibility triad wins:** Web + Auth + FIM/IDS together told the full story.
     - File integrity, HTTP, and authentication logs, together, told the whole story‚Ää-‚Ääindividually, they fell short.
- [ ] **Correlation over single signals:** Small clues become decisive when chained.
   - A stray JPEG, a brute-force login spike, or a POST to an upload path may mean little alone, but they become decisive when correlated.
- [ ] **Repeatability wins:** Turn ad-hoc queries into alerts/dashboards to cut toil.
   - Turning one-off queries into alerts and dashboards is how IR teams scale from reactive to proactive.
- [ ] **Context elevates detections:** VirusTotal lookups + decoded artifacts increase confidence.
   - Pivoting to VirusTotal and decoding artifacts sharpened attribution and raised confidence in the findings.
- [ ] **Evidence discipline:** IoCs + screenshots enable clean handoffs and audits.
    - Capturing IoCs and screenshots made the investigation auditable and ready for handoff.

## üèÅ **Conclusion**
This lab demonstrates how Splunk can turn raw logs into a clear timeline of compromise, containment, and hardening. By defining a time window, correlating data from multiple sources, and operationalizing detections, we not only confirmed the defacement but also created a repeatable playbook for future incidents.

In real-world Incident Response, the same rhythm applies: observe ‚Üí correlate ‚Üí validate ‚Üí harden. Practicing this in labs builds the muscle memory so that when alerts are real, the workflow feels intuitive and efficient.
